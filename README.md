I am a nascent data scientist who is about to start his masters at UW in Seattle, and I'm happily excited about it!

Also nascent is my online presence, which I am just now beginning to flesh out. Over the coming months, as I settle into my new life here in Seattle, I hope to post my work here as a portfolio supplement for potential employers.

Please feel free to reach out if you would like to make a connection. In this age of bullet points, I definitely prefer the paragraph and its person-to-person equivalent. I am always happy to talk, to share what I've learned, and to learn from others. Cheers!
